### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm somebody on the Internet ig. So far I haven't really used GitHub all that much, hence why I'm adding something to my "very special repository" as GitHub calls it to make my profile look prettier.

![yes](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/899368346808639498/912996514899562536/1635714434213.gif)

Oh and btw, I coded some stuff for minecraft and SCP:SL before. They're obv nothing very special and one of those projects didn't even fully work as I intended it to. :(
