### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm somebody on the Internet ig. So far I haven't really used GitHub all that much, hence why I'm adding something to my "very special repository" as GitHub calls it to make my profile look prettier.

Oh and btw, I coded some stuff for minecraft and SCP:SL before. Most of the things I do are game related...
